        <p>Questions:</p>
        <ul class="questions">
          <li>Is there a way to do math in the css file? (e.g. % of screen)</li>
          <li>Why do I have to specify the height of the div.tiles when trying to add margin to the top and bottom? And did i do that the best way possible?</li>
          <li>Why if I apply the question class to the div it doesn't apply to the list? Wouldn't descendants work? Same idea with margin within ul.footer vs. li</li>
          <li>Are there not defaults for borders? Ie. do I have to specify width, style, and color to get a border to show up?</li>
          <li>Can you explain the logic of display: "block and margin: 0 auto" I used for the images?</li>
          <li>Is there a way to control the level of indentation of a list? (e.g footer)</li>
          <li>Can you add 2 ids to an element? It would be nice to clump a bunch of the "tile" elements together...</li>
        </ul>
